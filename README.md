how to use:
1 execute: loadstring(game:HttpGet('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pycharmertutor/roblox-script/main/loader.lua'))() -- for most games
2 if rainbowfriends has any issues reexecute when a monster spawns and rainbowfriends has a other loadsting loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pycharmertutor/roblox-script/main/rainbowfriends.lua"))()
